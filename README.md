#Cookie Stepper
CS2063 Team 4 Term Project
A step tracking app with gamification elements and calorie tracking inspired by the popular game "Cookie Clicker".

The app has pre pre-loaded user profile, no google account or wearable devices needed. Just install the app and start walking!!
We have a pre-set goal of 6000 steps per day and as you walk and get steps you will see the progress ring update.
