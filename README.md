#Cookie Stepper
CS2063 Team 4 Term Project
A step tracking app with gamification elements and calorie tracking inspired by the popular game "Cookie Clicker".

The app has pre pre-loaded user profile, no google account or wearable devices needed. Just install the app and start walking!!
We have a pre-set goal of 6000 steps per day and as you walk and get steps you will see the progress ring update.

You will be given 100 points when you open the app, you are able to use these points in the Reward Shop to buy rewards.

On the BMI page, you can input your height and weight to calculate the amount of calories burnt.

On the Calories page, you can add food items that have been consumed, and adjust the portion size of each item. You can also view food history that will show the list of foods eaten.
